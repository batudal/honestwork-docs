# Recruiters
Recruiters are the user that are looking for short-term talents for their projects. They can post job listings, make deals and rate creators they've worked with on-chain just like creators.

HonestWork web application gives access to all of these functions to everyone with a wallet. Although it is possible to enlist job posts without having the membership, as a member you can also accumulate any generated revenue through our smart contracts.

HonestWork is committed to decentralization and it's quite possible we will have a token airdrop in the future that will be based on revenue and activity. Further, we plan on bringing features like `Projects` to serve multi-role users.


### Job listing

Anyone can post job listings on HonestWork platform. Best way to get more exposure is to purchase some sticky duration
for your job listing. 

|  Sticky duration  | Price         |
| --------------    | ------------- |
| 7 days            | $49           |
| 15 days           | $69           |
| 30 days           | $99           |

Don't forget to add some AI to the mix! We power HonestWork with ChatGPT to help you with the tedious filtering process. 

| AI Assistance     | Price         |

| 3 tokens          | $3            |
| 5 tokens          | $4            |
