# Introduction

Welcome to HonestWork user documentation. 

## What is HonestWork?

HonestWork is a one-stop platform for all your web3 freelancing needs. Our goal is to make it easy to find exceptional web3 freelancers and quality job offers for blockchain professionals.

Through the use of blockchain technology, HonestWork offers a secure and transparent way for freelancers and businesses to connect, communicate, and collaborate.

## Why freelancing?

The freelance market has seen continuous growth in recent years, with more skilled professionals opting to work on a project-by-project basis rather than committing to a traditional 9-to-5 job. The rise of skilled freelancing is clear, with 51% of post-grads doing freelance work, 6% more than in 2020.

This trend has been driven by various factors, including the increase of online platforms that make it easier for freelancers to find work and for businesses to find talent.

There are several popular freelance marketplaces already, but an innovative platform that utilizes blockchain technology can enhance user experience and bring solutions to the pain points of current platforms.

With that in mind, we created HonestWork, a decentralized app that connects freelancers and job posters in a unique and innovative way.
